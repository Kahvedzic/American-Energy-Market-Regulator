# American Energy Market Regulator (SQL and Tableau)

Project Summary:

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the reliability of the USA's domestic energy network, minimizing disruptions known as outages. Of the four types of outages, the AEMR penalizes only forced outages, as they can threaten network reliability if energy supply cannot meet demand. Recently, the AEMR has noted an increase in outage submissions for 2016 and 2017. The management team has two primary concerns, energy stability and market outages, and energy losses and market reliability. As an analyst, you are tasked with addressing these concerns by using SQL and Tableau to extract and analyze relevant data, answering queries, and providing additional insights for the management team.

# Part 1. AEMR SQL Case Study (SQL Jupyter Notebook)
- COUNT(*) :Counted all outages by year and month
- AVG: Calculated Average outage duration per plant, per year
- SQL Filtering
- Identified high risk plants

# Part 2. AEMR Tableau Presentation
- Examine how much energy was lost due to the outage types and the duration of these outage events in order for AEMR to put more focus on minimizing the outage events and duration to increase the reliability of the energy market

# Project Background

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the reliability of the USA's domestic energy network, minimizing disruptions known as outages. Of the four types of outages, the AEMR penalizes only forced outages, as they can threaten network reliability if energy supply cannot meet demand. Recently, the AEMR has noted an increase in outage submissions for 2016 and 2017. The management team has two primary concerns, energy stability and market outages, and energy losses and market reliability. As an analyst, you are tasked with addressing these concerns by using SQL and Tableau to extract and analyze relevant data, answering queries, and providing additional insights for the management team.

What's the Business Problem? üí∞

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of America‚Äôs domestic energy network. The regulator‚Äôs responsibility is to ensure that America‚Äôs energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions, which are known as outages.

There are four key types of outages:

‚óè Consequential

‚óè Forced

‚óè Opportunistic

‚óè Planned

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Recently, the AEMR management team has been increasingly aware of a large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017 calendar years. The management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern addressed:

A) Energy Stability and Market Outages

B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability

As an analyst within the data and reporting team, we've been asked to address these two immediate areas of concern
